// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subset. In other words,
//  you start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers.
//   Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher
//    than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number.
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subset. Return the array of numbers.
